# OpenWRT-NVG468MQ
An assessment of OpenWRT support for the Arris NVG468MQ (Frontier variant)

Headers were soldered to the SoC UART as well as the ethernet controller UART (it turns out a serial connection to the ethernet controller was entirely unnessecary and I would only add headers to the SoC UART if following this writeup)

The pins are conveniently labeled so we don't have to bother with checking voltage on the pins using a multimeter.
